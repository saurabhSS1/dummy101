To use a self-signed keystore in JBoss on OpenShift, you need to create a keystore with a self-signed certificate, upload it to OpenShift as a secret, and then configure JBoss to use it for SSL/TLS connections. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Generate a Self-Signed Keystore

Use the keytool command to create a self-signed keystore. This command generates a new keystore with a self-signed certificate:

keytool -genkeypair -alias myalias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 365 -keystore keystore.jks

	•	Replace myalias with an alias name for the certificate.
	•	You will be prompted to enter information for the certificate (e.g., name, organization, location).
	•	Set a password for the keystore and remember it, as you’ll need it for JBoss configuration.

Step 2: Verify the Keystore

After creating the keystore, verify that it contains the certificate:

keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.jks

You should see details about the certificate you just created.

Step 3: Upload the Keystore to OpenShift as a Secret

To make the keystore accessible to your JBoss application on OpenShift, upload it as a secret.
	1.	Create a secret from the keystore file:

oc create secret generic keystore-secret --from-file=keystore.jks=keystore.jks


	2.	Verify the secret by running:

oc get secrets



Step 4: Mount the Secret in Your JBoss Deployment

Configure your JBoss deployment to mount the keystore at a specified path, such as /opt/server-certs/keystore.jks.
	1.	Go to the Workloads > Deployments section in OpenShift and locate your JBoss deployment.
	2.	Edit the deployment configuration.
	3.	In the Volumes section, add a new volume:
	•	Volume Type: Secret.
	•	Secret Name: Select the secret you just created (e.g., keystore-secret).
	4.	In the Containers section, mount the volume to the path JBoss will use for the keystore, such as /opt/server-certs.
Example configuration:

volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /opt/server-certs
    name: keystore-volume



After this, the keystore will be available in the container at /opt/server-certs/keystore.jks.

Step 5: Configure JBoss to Use the Keystore

Edit your JBoss configuration (standalone.xml or domain.xml) to use the keystore for HTTPS connections. In the ApplicationRealm section (or whichever security realm is used for HTTPS), specify the keystore path, password, and type.

Example configuration in standalone.xml:

<security-realm name="ApplicationRealm">
    <server-identities>
        <ssl>
            <keystore path="/opt/server-certs/keystore.jks" relative-to="jboss.server.config.dir" keystore-password="your_keystore_password" type="JKS"/>
        </ssl>
    </server-identities>
</security-realm>

Replace your_keystore_password with the password you set for the keystore when you created it.

Step 6: Set Environment Variables (if needed)

Some OpenShift environments require environment variables to specify the keystore path, password, or type. You can set these in the deployment configuration as environment variables.

For example:

env:
  - name: KEYSTORE_PATH
    value: "/opt/server-certs/keystore.jks"
  - name: KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
    value: "your_keystore_password"
  - name: KEYSTORE_TYPE
    value: "JKS"

Step 7: Redeploy the Application

After configuring JBoss to use the new keystore, redeploy the application on OpenShift to apply the changes:

oc rollout restart deployment/<your-jboss-deployment>

Step 8: Verify HTTPS Connection

Once the application is redeployed, check if HTTPS is working correctly. Access your application via HTTPS and ensure it uses the self-signed certificate you configured.

Additional Notes

	•	Truststore: If your application needs to verify incoming client certificates, you may need to configure a truststore as well.
	•	Browser Warnings: Since this is a self-signed certificate, browsers will display a warning indicating that the certificate is not trusted. This is expected behavior with self-signed certificates.
