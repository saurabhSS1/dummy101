The error message highlighted in the screenshot, “java.security.KeyStoreException: Cannot get key bytes, not PKCS#8 encoded,” indicates that the private key in your keystore is not in the PKCS#8 format. For certain Java applications, including WildFly, keys need to be encoded in PKCS#8 format rather than PKCS#1.

Here’s how to resolve this issue:

Step 1: Convert the Private Key to PKCS#8 Format

If you have the private key in PKCS#1 format (which typically starts with -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----), you need to convert it to PKCS#8 format.
	1.	Export the Private Key from the Keystore (if it’s in the keystore and you have access):
	•	If you can’t directly access the private key, skip to Step 2.
	2.	Convert the Private Key to PKCS#8:
Use the following OpenSSL command to convert a private key from PKCS#1 to PKCS#8:

openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in private_key.pem -out private_key_pkcs8.pem -nocrypt

	•	Replace private_key.pem with the path to your original PKCS#1 private key.
	•	This command will create private_key_pkcs8.pem, which is in PKCS#8 format.
	•	Note: The -nocrypt option means the private key will not be encrypted.

	3.	Import the PKCS#8 Private Key Back into the Keystore:
	•	If you created a new PKCS#8 private key file, you’ll need to import it along with the corresponding certificate back into a new keystore.

Step 2: Create a New Keystore with the PKCS#8 Encoded Key

If you have a certificate file (certificate.crt) and the PKCS#8 private key (private_key_pkcs8.pem), you can create a new keystore with these components:
	1.	Combine the Certificate and PKCS#8 Key into a PKCS12 Keystore:

openssl pkcs12 -export -in certificate.crt -inkey private_key_pkcs8.pem -out new_keystore.p12 -name myalias

	•	Replace certificate.crt with the path to your certificate.
	•	Replace private_key_pkcs8.pem with the path to the converted PKCS#8 private key.
	•	Replace new_keystore.p12 with the desired name for the new keystore.
	•	Set a password for the keystore when prompted.

	2.	Convert the PKCS12 Keystore to JKS Format (if your application requires a JKS keystore):

keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore new_keystore.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore keystore.jks -deststoretype JKS

	•	This will create a JKS keystore (keystore.jks) containing the PKCS#8 encoded private key and certificate.

Step 3: Upload the New Keystore to OpenShift

	1.	Delete the Old Keystore Secret (if necessary):

oc delete secret keystore-secret


	2.	Create a New Secret with the Updated Keystore:

oc create secret generic keystore-secret --from-file=keystore.jks=keystore.jks


	3.	Update Your Application Configuration (if needed):
Ensure the new keystore path and password are correctly referenced in your application configuration (e.g., standalone.xml for WildFly).

Step 4: Redeploy the Application

Redeploy the application to apply the changes:
	1.	Scale down the deployment to 0 and back up to 1, or trigger a redeployment.
	2.	Check the logs after redeployment to confirm that the keystore is loaded successfully and that the PKCS#8 encoding issue is resolved.

Additional Note

The PKCS#8 format requirement is a common constraint in Java applications that use certain security libraries or frameworks. Ensuring that your private keys are in PKCS#8 format should resolve this specific issue.
