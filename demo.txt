The error java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: <init>(org.apache.logging.slf4j.Log4jLoggerFactory) indicates a conflict between SLF4J and Log4j versions. This typically happens when the versions of SLF4J, Log4j, or their bridges are incompatible or when multiple logging libraries are present.

Root Cause
	•	SLF4J is trying to bind to Log4j, but the required method or constructor is missing due to version mismatches.
	•	This can happen if you have both Log4j and another logging framework (like Logback) or incompatible versions in the classpath.

Solution Steps

1. Verify Dependencies

Check your build.gradle file and identify all logging dependencies. You may have multiple logging libraries conflicting.
	•	Use the following Gradle command to list dependencies:

./gradlew dependencies



Look for slf4j, log4j, or logback dependencies.

2. Fix Logging Dependency Conflict

Ensure you include only one logging framework and bridge SLF4J correctly to Log4j.

For Log4j 2 with SLF4J Integration, use the following dependencies:

// SLF4J API
implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.36'

// Log4j 2 Core and API
implementation 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api:2.17.2'
implementation 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core:2.17.2'

// SLF4J to Log4j2 bridge
implementation 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl:2.17.2'

3. Remove Conflicting Libraries

Exclude other logging libraries (e.g., Logback) to avoid clashes. For example:

configurations.all {
    exclude group: 'ch.qos.logback', module: 'logback-classic'
    exclude group: 'org.slf4j', module: 'slf4j-simple'
    exclude group: 'org.apache.logging.log4j', module: 'log4j-to-slf4j'
}

4. Clean and Rebuild

Clean your Gradle cache and rebuild the project:

./gradlew clean build

5. Verify SLF4J Binding at Runtime

If you want to confirm which logging implementation SLF4J is using at runtime, include:

System.out.println(org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getILoggerFactory());

You should see something like:
org.apache.logging.slf4j.Log4jLoggerFactory.

Final Notes
	•	Use consistent versions of SLF4J and Log4j libraries (e.g., 1.7.x for SLF4J and 2.x for Log4j).
	•	Avoid including multiple logging implementations in the classpath.

Let me know if you need help refining your dependencies further!
