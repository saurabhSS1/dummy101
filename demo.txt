Dear [Hiring Manager’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Saurabh Suratkar, and I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Barclays, Pune. I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer Full Stack role (Ref: JR-0000002474), as I strongly believe my skills and experience align with the responsibilities and qualifications outlined for this position.

At Barclays, I have successfully delivered solutions that integrate legacy and modern systems. Specifically, I led the development of the Real-Time Sanction API, which processes 690+ requests per hour with 20-30% scalability, and the Task Management API, seamlessly integrating Salesforce and achieving 90%+ code coverage through rigorous testing using JUnit and Mockito. My hands-on expertise includes technologies such as Java (Core), Spring Boot, Microservices, RESTful APIs, and containerization tools like Docker and Kubernetes, all of which directly align with the requirements for this role.

Additionally, I have demonstrated proficiency in using DevOps tools such as Jenkins and OpenShift, as well as a solid understanding of messaging concepts like Kafka. My experience extends to test-driven development (TDD) and maintaining high code quality using tools like SonarQube and Veracode, ensuring robust and secure systems.

The opportunity to contribute to Barclays’ mission of driving digital transformation through cutting-edge technologies excites me. I am passionate about creating scalable and resilient systems, and I am confident that my technical skills, problem-solving ability, and collaborative mindset will add significant value to the team.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss my application further. Please let me know if there is any additional information you require. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to the continued success of Barclays.

Warm regards,
