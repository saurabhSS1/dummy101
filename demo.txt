Subject: Application for Senior Full Stack Developer Role

Dear Sir,

I hope this email finds you well. It’s always a privilege to witness your leadership and the impact you bring to the team at Barclays. I am writing to express my keen interest in the Senior Full Stack Developer role (Java, Angular) in your team.

This opportunity means a great deal to me, as I’ve admired the exceptional work under your guidance and aspire to contribute meaningfully to the team’s success. With my hands-on experience in Java, Microservices, Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, and OpenShift, coupled with my strong understanding of database management and CI/CD pipelines, I am confident in my ability to deliver results and exceed expectations.

To demonstrate my commitment and capabilities, I am more than willing to build a prototype or contribute to any immediate project needs as per your requirements. My primary goal is to add value to the team and organization, and I am flexible with the role level—even starting at BA3, should the opportunity arise.

I deeply believe in the purpose of this role and am eager to work under your guidance to design and deliver high-quality software solutions that drive innovation and excellence at Barclays. Please let me know if there’s anything further I can do to strengthen my application.

Thank you for considering my request. It would truly be an honor to work under your leadership.

Warm regards,
Saurabh Suratkar
