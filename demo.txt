Here’s a more detailed and convincing version of the suggestion:

"Hi [Manager's Name],

I’d like to propose a flexible approach for our in-office days. Instead of requiring a fixed 2 days per week, we could allow employees to complete their 8 mandatory days in the office across the month at their discretion. This would give everyone the freedom to manage their work-life balance better, especially during busy personal periods, while still maintaining a regular office presence.

Such flexibility could also boost morale and productivity, as employees can plan around both their personal commitments and high-priority work tasks. It might also lead to a more efficient use of office space by reducing the peak occupancy on certain days.

I believe this could be a win-win for both the team and the business. Please let me know what you think!"

This version adds more emphasis on benefits and business advantages. Let me know if it works!
